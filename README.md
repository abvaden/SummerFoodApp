# Working with project
To publish fulfillment code to lambda you can use the npm publish script. This will read the configuration parameters stored in a user secret file aws-lambda-user-settings.json in the root of the project to publish the code to lambda (still a work in progress).

While the publish feature is being worked on the source code can be compiled by running npm run prepublish.
